  ---help---
    specify the requested heap size in bytes.

config APP_DFUUSB_STACKSIZE
  int "Stack size"
  depends on APP_DFUUSB
  default 8192
  ---help---
    Specify the application stack size, in bytes. By default, set to 8192
    (i.e. 8k). Depending on the number of slots required, and the usage,
    the stack can be bigger or smaller.

config APP_DFUUSB_PRIO
  int "Application priority"
  default 0
  ---help---
    Set the application priority (between 0 (the lower) to 255 (the higher)).
    Only used when the RMA scheduler is executed. In this later case:
    - Tasks of higher priority are executed while they are runnable
    - Tasks of same priority are executed respecting a Round-Robin scheduling
    When using priority and RMA scheduling, please take care to yield()
    as much as possible to avoid deny of service to lower priority tasks

config APP_DFUUSB_PERM_DEV_DMA
    bool "App has capacity to register DMA streams"
    default n
    ---help---
    if no, the application can't declare a DMA. If y, the application
    is able to require one or more secure DMA stream(s).

config APP_DFUUSB_PERM_DEV_CRYPTO
    int "App can interact with HW cryptographic module"
    default 0
    range 0 3
    ---help---
    If 0, the application has no access to any HW cryp module.
    If 1, the application is able to use a HW cryp module configured
    by another application.
    If 2, the application is able to configure (inject keys) but can't
    use the crypt module (no IRQ handler).
    If 3, the application as a full, autonomous access to the HW cryp
    module

config APP_DFUUSB_PERM_DEV_BUSES
    bool "App has capacity to use buses (SPI, I2C, USART...)"
    default n
    ---help---
    If n, the application can't access any buses (I2C, SPI, USART).
    If y, the application can require a bus mapping.

config APP_DFUUSB_PERM_DEV_TIM
    bool "App can register a hardware timer"
    default n

    If n, the application can't require a timer from the kernel (using
    the timer API). If y, the application can require one or more HW
    timer(s).

    bool "App is allowed to request main thread execution after ISR"
    default n
    ---help---
    If y, the application is able to request its main thread execution
    just after specific ISRs. This is done using the dev_irq_mode_t
    structure in device_t struct, using the IRQ_ISR_FORCE_MAINTHREAD value.
    If n, this field can't be set to this value.

config APP_DFUUSB_PERM_TSK_FIPC
    bool "App is allowed to request peer execution on syncrhnous send IPC"

    when sending syncrhonous IPC.

config APP_DFUUSB_PERM_TSK_RESET
    bool "App is allowed to request a board software reset"
    default n
    ---help---
    If y, the application is able to request a MCU reset. This is usefull
    only if the application is handling events that require urgent reactivity
    implying board reset.

config APP_DFUUSB_PERM_TSK_UPGRADE
    bool "App is allowed to upgrade the firmware"
    default n
    ---help---
    If y, the application is able to map the embedded flash device in
    order to upgrade the overall firmware. This permission should
    be hosted by a task with no external access (USB, USART...)

config APP_DFUUSB_PERM_TSK_RNG
    bool "App is allowed to access an an entropy input source, through sys_get_random"

    mapped, but that are mapped/unmapped voluntary using sys_cfg() syscalls.
    This permission does not give access to any devices not already declared
    but allow dynamic (un)mapping of previously declared ones.
